# Android verify gate: runs on every PR (and push to branches).
# Executes ci_scripts/android_verify.sh (Skip transpile, unit tests, assemble, install, launch smoke).
# Requires: Skip (macOS), Gradle, Android SDK, and a running emulator (started by this workflow).
# Note: Android emulator hardware acceleration is unreliable on Apple Silicon hosted
# runners (HVF unsupported on some VMs). Keep this job on Intel for stable boot.
